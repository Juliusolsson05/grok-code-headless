// HeadlessTerminal — wraps @xterm/headless around a consumer-owned PTY.
//
// The consumer spawns the PTY (they own the binary, args, env, cwd)
// and passes the IPty instance here. We pipe its output into a
// headless Terminal, emit throttled screen snapshots, and accept
// write-through keystrokes. No process management — we never spawn
// or kill anything.
//
// This is the foundation primitive both claude-code-headless and
// codex-headless build on.
//
// --- Lifecycle ---------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The constructor is INERT. It builds the headless xterm but does NOT
// subscribe to PTY events. The consumer is expected to call attach()
// after any other state that depends on PTY events (transcript tailers,
// log captures, recorders) has been wired up. Without this split, the
// PTY started emitting bytes as soon as `new HeadlessTerminal(...)`
// returned, which made the "tailer attached before terminal starts
// processing PTY data" invariant a polite fiction. Now it's enforceable:
// the terminal mirror does nothing until you call attach().
//
// --- write() race fix --------------------------------------------------------
//
// xterm's term.write() is async — the documented contract says the
// optional callback fires once the data has been fully parsed into the
// buffer. A naive implementation that calls term.write(data) and then
// schedules a snapshot on a setTimeout will race: the snapshot can fire
// before the buffer reflects the bytes we just wrote. Our previous
// implementation had this bug, and the testing/replay.ts script papered
// over it with a 50ms sleep. Now we explicitly use the callback as the
// signal to schedule a flush, so each snapshot is guaranteed to reflect
// every PTY byte that was already written.
//
// --- Viewport vs. full buffer ------------------------------------------------
//
// "Current screen" parsers (slash picker, trust dialog, activity,
// streaming text, in-progress assistant) all want the visible viewport
// only — what the user is looking at right now. Iterating buf.length
// includes 10k rows of scrollback, which means stale prompts, stale
// pickers, and stale assistant text from earlier turns leak into the
// "current state" parsers. snapshotPlain / snapshotMarkdown now scan
// the viewport region only (viewportY .. viewportY + term.rows). The
// scrollback is still kept in the xterm buffer for users who want to
// scroll back in the consumer UI; it just isn't fed to the parsers.

  // KNOWN ISSUE: the 'screen' event can stall under synchronized output
  //
  // (Back-ported from claude-code-headless's copy of this file, where the
  // bug was discovered and documented — the two copies had drifted and this
  // operational knowledge was lost here. See agent-code#394 §8.)
  //
  // TUIs that use the synchronized-output protocol wrap redraws in
  // `\x1b[?2026h … \x1b[?2026l` so the terminal renders the new frame
  // atomically. `@xterm/headless` parses those sequences correctly into
  // the buffer, but its `write(data, cb)` callback timing is influenced
  // by them: under sustained sync-output pressure the per-chunk callbacks
  // can land in a way that leaves `pendingWrites` > 0 indefinitely, so
  // `scheduleFlush()` is never re-armed and consumers stop receiving
  // 'screen' events even though the buffer is being updated correctly.
  //
  // This was discovered against Claude Code's TUI (see the paste-submit
  // reproduction harness at Agent Code's
  // `vendor/in_progress/paste-submit-repro/`), but the mechanism lives in
  // the shared pendingWrites/write-callback pattern below, which this
  // copy shares byte-for-byte — Codex's TUI also emits synchronized
  // output, so the same stall is possible here.
  //
  // What this means for consumers:
  //   * If you only need a periodic snapshot for diagnostics or parsing,
  //     prefer a fixed-interval poll of `snapshotPlain()` /
  //     `snapshotMarkdown()` over subscribing to 'screen'.
  //   * If you DO subscribe to 'screen' for low-latency reaction, you
  //     MUST also have a wall-clock timeout fallback because the event
  //     may never fire in this session.
  //
  // A real fix would be either: drop the pendingWrites counter and
  // schedule a flush on every `pty.onData` (cheap, more events but no
  // stalls); or replace the @xterm/headless callback mechanism with our
  // own write→parse barrier.

      //
      // WHY this exists: agent TUIs redraw their composer/spinner
      // chrome continuously while "working", so PTY data flows — and
      // re-arms this flush — even when the visible text is unchanged
      // frame after frame. Before this gate, every such frame paid
      // for two per-cell markdown walks (terminalToMarkdown over
      // viewport + ~200 recent rows), the downstream parsers, the
      // event emissions, and an IPC forward of four strings. With ~10
      // live sessions that was the dominant allocation source in
      // Agent Code's main process (GC storm, agent-code#390). The
      // renderer already had a bail-out for identical frames; gating
      // here means main stops paying to produce frames the renderer
      // was discarding anyway.
      //
      // WHY compare BOTH plain and recent: plain is viewport-only. A
      // program spewing identical lines can scroll new content into
      // scrollback while the viewport text stays byte-identical;
      // comparing `recent` (last ~200 rows) too keeps the streaming
      // extractors' window honest. If all 200 recent rows are
      // byte-identical, the extractors would see identical input
      // anyway, so skipping is safe by construction.
      //
      // KNOWN TRADEOFF: attribute-only changes (e.g. a cell flips
      // bold with identical characters) no longer produce a snapshot,
      // because both gate strings are attribute-blind. Every current
      // consumer keys off text content or reads the live grid via
      // getTerminal(), so nothing observable regresses; revisit if a
      // consumer ever needs attribute-driven cadence.
